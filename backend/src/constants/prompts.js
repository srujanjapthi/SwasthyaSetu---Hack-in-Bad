- Plank Time
- Squats
- Weight and BMI

üß† For each metric:
- Comment on whether the value is healthy, low, or high
- Mention possible causes (e.g., fatigue, stress, lack of sleep, dehydration)
- If applicable, suggest **any potential disease or condition** that the value might hint at
- Recommend if the student should consider **consulting a doctor** or improving their routine

üìù Important:
- Keep the tone conversational, short, and clear.
- Avoid medical jargon unless necessary.
- End with a brief summary and actionable advice for the student.

Here is the student's physical health record for your analysis:
${JSON.stringify(physicalHealthRecord, null, 2)}
